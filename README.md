Tech Elevator May 2023 Capstone Project for Nick Amstutz

**Family Reading Tracker**

See it in action on its **[Github Page!](https://namstutz.github.io/namstutz-te-capstone)**

This app was built by my group of four Tech Elevator students at the conclusion of the bootcamp. Starting with a project template empty except for the basic authentication functions, we worked in Agile sprints for just under two weeks. By the end, we created a product that met all the minimum requirements set by our Product Owner and exceeded them with some of our personal touches and feature ideas!

This repository contains the Vue source code in the `main` branch and the built project in the `dist` branch. For your viewing convenience, it also contains the Java code (just the classes) in the java-backend-code folder. The Spring Boot server and Postgres database are currently hosted on [fly.io](https://fly.io).
